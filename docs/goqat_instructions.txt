>> sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
>> sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
>> sudo apt-get install libtiff4-dev (And perhaps libtiff4, too)
>> sudo apt-get install libxt-dev (for xpa messaging if you want GoQat to show it in ds9 when it captures an image)

From this gnome source mirror:
http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/sources/[glib,atk,pango,etc.]

download and install the following libraries (using the exact version numbers shown below) in this order:

1. glib-2.31.22

When done with glib, run: sudo ldconfig

2. atk-2.1.5
3. pango-1.29.5
4. gdk-pixbuf-2.23.5

Now enter this on the command line:

>> export LDFLAGS="/usr/local/lib/libgthread-2.0.so /usr/local/lib/libglib-2.0.so /usr/local/lib/libgobject-2.0.so"

And then continue to config and make these libraries:

5. gtk+-3.2.4
6. goocanvas-2.0.2

From its own website, download and install

7. libusbx (even though libusb-1.0.0 and libusb-1.0.0-dev are probably already on the system, GoQat uses the updated version libusbx)

8. xpa: http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/xpa/

9. ds9: http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html

>> sudo ldconfig

Now configure and make goqat
